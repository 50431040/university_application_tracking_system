# University Application Tracking System

A comprehensive web application that helps high school students manage their university applications, track deadlines, and monitor their progress through the college admissions process. Built with Next.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and Tailwind CSS.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This application addresses the complex needs of students applying to 8-15 universities across different application systems (Common App, Coalition App, Direct Applications). It provides role-based access for students and parents, with future extensibility for teachers and administrators.

### Key Features

- **Application Management**: Track multiple university applications with deadline monitoring
- **Status Workflow**: Complete application lifecycle from "not started" to final decisions
- **University Database**: Searchable database with filtering by location, ranking, acceptance rates
- **Role-Based Access**: Student and parent dashboards with appropriate permissions
- **Requirements Tracking**: Individual requirement management (essays, transcripts, recommendations)
- **Progress Visualization**: Dashboard with statistics and upcoming deadlines
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with accessibility compliance
